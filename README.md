# PartyExplorerApp
Welcome to the Party Feed App! This is a simple iOS application built using Xcode, Swift, and SwiftUI, allowing users to scroll through a list of party cards, filter parties by name, generate new parties randomly, and add new parties.

## Tech Requirements
To contribute or run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Xcode: The IDE for developing iOS applications.
- Swift: The programming language used for iOS app development.
- SwiftUI: The framework for building user interfaces in a declarative way.

## Features
### Party Feed
Scroll through a list of party cards displaying names, images, prices, attendees' count, and dates.
### Party Filtering
Filter the party card list by searching for a party name using a search algorithm.
### TODO: Random Party Generation
Generate new parties randomly with a name, banner image, price, and start/end date.
Only the party name and image URL are randomly chosen from an existing array of values.
Not every randomly-generated party contains an end date.
### Add New Party
Press a button to add a new party with randomly generated details.
### Initial Feed
When the app is first opened, no less than 3 randomly-generated parties should exist in the feed.
